# Parking Space Detection

Parking Space Detection is a real-time system developed in Python using OpenCV. This project enables the detection of parking spaces in a given area and counts the number of available parking spaces as well as the number of cars occupying those spaces. It utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm for real-time car detection within defined parking spaces.

## Features

- Detect and count available parking spaces in real-time.
- Count the number of cars occupying parking spaces.
- Display live counts of available parking spaces and occupied spaces.
- Draw polygons on video frames to define parking spaces.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maruf9911/Parking_sapce_detection.git


Usage
Run the project following the installation steps above.
Click and drag the mouse to draw polygons on the video frame to define parking spaces.
The system will detect cars within the defined parking spaces and display the count of available parking spaces as well as the count of occupied spaces in real-time.
Press the 's' key to save the drawn polygons and their corresponding numbers for future use.
